### 项目概述
`MyBabyAGI`是一个基于Python的项目，旨在创建一个简单的AI代理（BabyAGI），该代理能够根据给定的目标（objective）执行任务。它使用语言模型链（LLMChain）来创建、优先排序和执行任务。此外，该项目还使用了向量存储（VectorStore）来存储任务的执行结果，以便后续的相似性搜索。
### 核心功能
1. **任务创建链（TaskCreationChain）**:
   - 根据上一个任务的执行结果和给定的目标创建新任务。
   - 避免创建与现有未完成任务重叠的任务。
2. **任务优先级链（TaskPrioritizationChain）**:
   - 清理任务格式并重新排序任务列表。
   - 考虑到团队的整体目标，对任务进行优先级排序。
3. **执行链（ExecutionChain）**:
   - 基于给定的目标和上下文执行任务。
4. **BabyAGI控制器**:
   - 管理任务列表、任务ID计数器和任务执行流程。
   - 使用向量存储来存储和检索任务结果。
### 代码结构
- `babyAGI.py`: 包含了BabyAGI的核心逻辑和类定义。
- `__pycache__`: 存储了Python编译后的字节码文件。
- `test.py`: 可能用于测试项目功能的Python文件。
- `requirements.txt`: 列出了项目依赖的Python库。
### 运行示例
```python
OBJECTIVE = "Write a weather report for SF today"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
verbose = False
max_iterations: Optional[int] = 10
baby_agi = BabyAGI.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    vectorstore=vector_store,
    verbose=verbose,
    max_iterations=max_iterations,
)
baby_agi._call({"objective": OBJECTIVE})
```
在上面的示例中，BabyAGI被初始化并赋予一个目标：为旧金山今天编写一个天气预报。然后，它开始执行任务，创建新任务，优先排序任务，并存储执行结果。
### 依赖库
- `langchain`
- `pydantic`
- `faiss-cpu` 或 `faiss-gpu`（用于向量搜索）
### 注意事项
- 项目需要有效的API密钥来访问OpenAI模型。
- 项目可能需要进一步的测试和优化，以确保稳定性和性能。
- 项目需要添加自己的.env环境，配置对应的OPEN_API_KEY

### 预期结果

Good morning! As requested, here is your weather report for San Francisco today.

Currently, the temperature in San Francisco is 62°F with a high of 68°F and a low of 55°F. The humidity is at 72%, which means it may feel a bit muggy outside. The wind speed is at 10 mph, so it may be a bit breezy.      

Based on these conditions, it would be a good idea to bring a light jacket or sweater with you if you plan on being outside for an extended period of time. Also, be sure to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade if you are doing any outdoor activities.

I have also completed the task of making a todo list for you, which includes reminders to check the weather before heading out and to bring appropriate clothing and accessories.

I hope this information helps you plan your day accordingly. Have a great day in San Francisco!
